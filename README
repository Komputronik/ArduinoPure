This is a very simple README to explain the way ArduinoPure works.

Simple tutorial:
1. Symlink (or copy) the right makefile to "Makefile". Example: cp ./Makefile.stk500_atmega ./Makefile
2. Run "make" to compile the project (which is main.cpp)
3. Run "make upload" to upload the compiled hex code to your microcontroller.

If you want to do more with ArduinoPure, you need to modify the Makefile.
For Arduino projects, please edit the first few lines of the Makefile.arduino file
For other projects (especially those that use the STK500, because its default configuration is to use the stk500 programmer), please edit the first few lines of the Makefile.general file.
