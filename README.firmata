I had to do a few tweaks to get Firmata working with ArduinoPure, here's a list:
 * Imported all the libraries from the Arduino libraries folder. That's Wire, Servo and Firmata.
 * Renamed twi.c to twi.cpp
 * Commented out the 'extern "C"' part in Wire.cpp, it resulted in undefined references.
 * Edited the Makefile, added the other sources. (twi.cpp, Wire.cpp, Servo.cpp, Firmata.cpp)
 * Added StandardFirmata.cpp from the Arduino StandardFirmata.ino example
 * Edited the StandardFirmata.cpp file, added prototypes for the functions and the Arduino.h header so it compiles correctly with ArduinoPure

Have fun with Firmata in ArduinoPure!
